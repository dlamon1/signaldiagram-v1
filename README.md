# Signal Diagram

### About

Signal Diagram is a Svelte app designed to create signal and power diagrams for modular LED screen builds. It is completely free, requires no login, and stores no cookies from user sessions. PNG files can be download from the Export button in the toolbar. Saving a layout downloads a .json file. This file can be loaded into the app to recall a configuration.

Signal Diagram utilizes the [d3.js libarary](https://d3js.org/) to draw.
